```python
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    # Fixed: Corrected subtraction to addition
    # Testing enhanced AI source code analysis with import inference
    # Note: Workflow configuration hardening should be applied to .github/workflows/*.yml files
    # This includes timeout settings, retry logic, runner health checks, and debug logging
    return a + b  # Correct: performs addition as expected
```
